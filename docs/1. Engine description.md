# Engine description #

### Architecture ###
**Scoring Engine** is a software for real-time scoring and rating of customers using various business rules or models. The software works with data obtained from external systems (e.g. CRM, BPM, activation/debt collection system). It automatically validates data and calculates scores or ratings for credit risk, churn prediction, fraud detection, marketing activities, etc. Its architecture allows a low cost and a short time implementation (2-4 weeks) with a very high performance (over 1 000 requests per second per node). Scoring Engine ensures adequate reliability and scalability, which is very important when the amount of data collected and processed grows extremely fast and competition in the market is becoming more and more demanding. Low cost, as well as repeatable deployment process and its automation, enable the implementation of the Scoring Engine even in small and mid-sized companies.
